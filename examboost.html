        <h2>Study Tips and Strategies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Create a Study Schedule:</strong> Plan your study time in advance and stick to a routine. Break down topics by days and allocate specific hours to each subject. Include short breaks to avoid burnout.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Active Learning Techniques:</strong> Instead of passively reading, engage with the material by taking notes, asking questions, or teaching someone else. Practice recalling information without looking at your notes (self-testing).</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Important Topics:</strong> Focus on the key concepts that are most likely to appear on the exam. Review any areas where you feel weakest or least confident.</li>
            <li><strong>Break Down Large Tasks:</strong> Avoid overwhelming yourself by breaking down large subjects into smaller, manageable sections. Tackle one section at a time to make steady progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Study Tools:</strong> Use flashcards, mind maps, and diagrams to organize and visualize information. Create summaries or outlines to condense notes into the most important points.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong> Study for 25-30 minutes, then take a 5-10 minute break (Pomodoro Technique). Use breaks to refresh your mind by moving around or relaxing.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Past Exams:</strong> Solve past exam papers or practice tests to familiarize yourself with the exam format. This also helps in timing yourself and identifying any knowledge gaps.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Keep your study area clean and organized to minimize distractions. Use checklists to track topics you’ve studied and what’s left to review.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Healthy:</strong> Eat nutritious food, stay hydrated, and get enough sleep. Avoid pulling all-nighters; a well-rested mind performs better.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Positive:</strong> Stay confident and trust your preparation. Use positive affirmations and stay motivated to keep stress at bay.</li>
        </ol>
